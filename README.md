# Test Fabric
## Test task for the interview
stack: Django, Docker, Celery (/Flower), Redis, Postgres

This project demonstrates how to send messages to a desired API using Django, Celery, Redis, and Postgres, all dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.

- Add dispatch object via DRF api page /api/v1/dispatch/
- âœ¨Magic happened and added task will be parsed by client's phone operator and tag
- Message will be sent according to the local time of the client, specified in the client's timezone
- Can be easily controlled by API

## Features

- Dispatch Object Management:
> Dispatch objects, containing essential dispatch information, can be added via the DRF API.
- Message Tracking:
> Every message, whether sent or not, is recorded along with the correct delivery status.
- Client Information Storage:
> Client information, including phone number, operator, timezone, and tags, is stored.
> The client's operator is automatically added, even if the operator field is left empty.
- Timezone-based Messaging:
> Messages are sent according to the specified timezone of the client.
